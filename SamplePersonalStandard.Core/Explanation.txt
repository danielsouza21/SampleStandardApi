Value Objects:
Value objects represent concepts that are defined by their attributes rather than an identity.
They are immutable and should be treated as such. Once created, their state cannot be changed. They dont have Id.
Examples include dates, money, addresses, and any other objects whose equality is based on their property values.

Entities:
Entities are objects that have a distinct identity that runs through time and different states.
Unlike value objects, entities are mutable. Their identity remains the same even if their attributes change.
Examples of entities include users, orders, or any object whose lifecycle is important and needs to be tracked.

Aggregates:
Aggregates are clusters of domain objects that are treated as a single unit. They ensure consistency and transactional integrity.
An aggregate typically contains one or more entities and value objects. It has a root entity, known as the aggregate root, through which all access and manipulation of the aggregate occur.
Aggregates encapsulate business rules and invariants, ensuring that the objects within the aggregate remain in a consistent state.
Examples of aggregates include order and its line items, or a blog post with its comments.
